# FlavorFinder

Welcome to FlavorFinder! This application lets you find recipes based on ingredients you have, save your favorite recipes, and explore detailed instructions and ingredient lists. 



## Backend

This Section describes the setup and configuration of the backend for the FlavorFinder app. The backend is built with Koa, a lightweight and expressive framework for Node.js, and uses MongoDB with Mongoose for the data layer. It also interacts with the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe data.

Install the project dependencies: npm install (refer the dependencies in package.json )

Start the Koa server: npm start
