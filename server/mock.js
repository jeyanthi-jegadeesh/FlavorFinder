I think aluminium foil will not work.\nSlowly add the butter-honey mix to the flour-sesame mix and start combining with a spatula. You might need little less or more honey mix if your flour is chunky or fine. The mix once done will resemble a loose cookie dough [but not runny]\nSpoon a dollop [approx 1 tbsp] of the mix on the parchment paper.Dip a fork in oil & flatten out the mix with the help of the back of the fork.\nBake in oven for 8 -10 minutes or until the crisps are brown.You really need to keep a watch on these coz they cook really fast.\nOnce done,take out of the oven and if you want, use a cookie cutter while still warm to a desired shape.\nLet the crisps cool before stacking them in air tight container.",
